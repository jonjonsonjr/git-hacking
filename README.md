# git-hacking

Boss walking towards you? Friends mocking your hacking skills? Impress and shame with git-hacking by channeling the prowess of a thousand Unix beards.

Git-hacking is an application designed for the lazy at heart; allowing you to recreate code and feel like a real hacker as the wind moves through your beard and you breeze through code. 

Step into the shoes of the original author of any codebase by pointing git-hacking at a git repository and pressing just a few random keystrokes. Within moments you'll have code flying across your screen as if you were Neo himself.

Think hackertyper, but with a targeted codebase.
